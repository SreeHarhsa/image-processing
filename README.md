## Project Overview
This project was developed to support astronomical data science by providing tools for preprocessing and analyzing images. The main goal is to process raw astronomical images to identify, filter, and measure various image attributes. This can be beneficial for research in astronomy and data science.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load astronomical images in various formats for preprocessing.
- **Image Processing**: Includes functions for transformations, noise reduction, filtering, and feature extraction.
- **Analysis**: Detects and measures significant features like celestial bodies and artifacts.
- **Visualization**: Provides tools to visualize processed images and extracted features.

## Installation
To run this project, youâ€™ll need Python and the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. **Load the Notebook**: Open `Spartificial_img_processsing_1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Execute Cells**: Run each cell sequentially to process sample astronomical images.
3. **Visualization**: Use the provided visualization functions to examine processed images and extracted features.

## File Structure
- **Spartificial_img_processsing_1.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the code for image processing and analysis.
